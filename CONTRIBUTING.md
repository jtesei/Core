# How to contribute

First of all, thank you for showing interest in contributing to NovaIran initiative.

You can either help with an existing project, or initiate a new one.

Either way, please follow these steps:

1. Join our Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/R76M7vedbe) for adhoc discussions and alignment.
2. Go to the #check-your-role channel and express your expertise using the available Emojis. This will help with recruitment for new projects.

## How can I initiate a new project?

1. Check out the [Ideas section of the Core repository](https://github.com/NovaIran/Core/discussions), and make sure your idea hasn't been already listed there.
2. If the idea is labeled as "Under development" in the Ideas section, feel free to join the initiative on Discord.
3. If the idea is listed but not marked as "Under development", you can initiate the project in Discord. Mention the required skills (e.g. @Programming) in the #recruitment Discord channel to build your team. If enough members show interest, you can request one of the Discord admins to create a new Github repository for the project.
4. If the idea is not listed at all, post your idea on Github, and follow step 2.
